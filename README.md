# The-Book-Shelf
An Android app which reviews and provides sneak peaks of famous movies and TV shows that are based on novels.

## Inspiration
Got the inspiration when I discovered CardView in Android and decided to turn my book shelf into an app.

## How it is built
- [x] Uses **CardView** and **RecyclerView** along with **GridLayout** to build the UI

- [x] Built an Adapter class to transfer of data from database to the *main book activity*
